                    Specifies if the bean is an abstract bean. Abstract beans act as parents for 
                    concrete bean definitions and are not instantiated. The default is "false".
                    Setting this to "true" instructs the bean factory not to instantiate the bean.
                    See documentation for attribute abstract in attribute group beanAttributes

                    A list of beans that the bean depends on being instantiated before it 
                    can be instantiated.
                    See documentation for attribute depends-on in attribute group beanAttributes

                    Specifies that the user created that bean using CXF APIs like
                    Endpoint.publish or Service.getPort.
                    The default is "false".
                    Setting this to "true" does the following: Changes the internal name of the
                    bean by appending either ".jaxws-client" or ".jaxws-endpoint" to the bean's
                    id. Makes the bean abstract.
